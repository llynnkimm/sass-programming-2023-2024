# Headings
We create headings in Markdown using hash (#) symbols

To create subheadings, we can use multiple hash symbols

## This is a level 2 subheading

### This is a level 3 subheading

###### This is a level 6 subheading


# Modifying Text Style
## Bold and Italics
We use asterisks (\*) to modify text styling, specifically
bold and italics

Eg.

I want this **word** specifically to be bold

I want this *word* to be italicized

I want this ***word*** to be both bold and italicized

## Escape Characters
**ASIDE:** If we want to place a character that is a *keyword* or a *reserved* word, and we want the literal CHARACTER use the forward slash (\\)
	Eg. If we want to put an asterisk, we do this \\\*

## ~~Strikethrough~~
We can also strikethrough characters using the tilde (~)
I want to strikethrough this specific ~~word~~ 
~~This sentence is stuck through~~

# Links 
We can link things in our Markdown files
[One tool to use](https://chat.openai.com)
Exercise: 
* If you have an openai account, do the following:
	* ask chatgpt to create for you markdown code that is a link to two websites of your choice

Eg. 
	[Visit Lululemon Men's Section](https://shop.lululemon.com/c/men/_/N-7tu)
	[Visit Nike Canada Men's Page](https://www.nike.com/ca/men)
