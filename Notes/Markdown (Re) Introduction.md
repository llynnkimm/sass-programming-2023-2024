# Headings
We create headings in Markdown using hash (#) symbols

To create subheadings, we can use multiple hash symbols

## This is a level 2 subheading

### This is a level 3 subheading

###### This is a level 6 subheading


# Modifying Text Style
## Bold and Italics
We use asterisks (\*) to modify text styling, specifically
bold and italics

Eg.

I want this **word** specifically to be bold

I want this *word* to be italicized

I want this ***word*** to be both bold and italicized

## Escape Characters
**ASIDE:** If we want to place a character that is a *keyword* or a *reserved* word, and we want the literal CHARACTER use the forward slash (\\)
	Eg. If we want to put an asterisk, we do this \\\*

## ~~Strikethrough~~
We can also strikethrough characters using the tilde (~)
I want to strikethrough this specific ~~word~~ 
~~This sentence is stuck through~~

# Links 
We can link things in our Markdown files
[One tool to use](https://chat.openai.com)
Exercise: 
* If you have an openai account, do the following:
	* ask chatgpt to create for you markdown code that is a link to two websites of your choice

Eg. 
	[Visit Lululemon Men's Section](https://shop.lululemon.com/c/men/_/N-7tu)
	[Visit Nike Canada Men's Page](https://www.nike.com/ca/men)

# Method Two Doesn't Work

# Block Quotes  
Block quotes allow us to emphasize a bigger chunk of text. We use carets(>) to create block quotes> This is an example of a blockquote  
> This is line two of the blockquote  
>  
> This is the fourth line; the third is blank# Lists  
We can create both unordered and ordered lists# Unordered Lists  
To create each point, we use ( *) with a space behind ite.g  
* Dairy  
* eggs  
* Milk  
* Cheese# Ordered ListsIf there is a specific order to the elements in our list,  
we create ordered lists  
we use numbers followed by periods to create the ordered listse.g.  
1. Put butter into mixing bowl  
2. Add sugar to butter (*hold shift to get the second line*)  
   Add both brown and regular sugar  
3. Use the mixer to cream the butter and sugar together# Tables  
We can organize information in tables using Markdown  
We use dashes (-) and pipes (|)Tables in Markdown require headingse.g.| Name        | Age        | Sign        | Superpower      |  
| ---         | ---        | ---         | ---             |  
| Bruce Wayne | 35         | Aquarius    | Intelligence/ $ |  
| Mr. Ubial   | Unaging    | All of them | Dad strength    |  
| Yourself    | Your age   | Your Sign   | Super strength  |
