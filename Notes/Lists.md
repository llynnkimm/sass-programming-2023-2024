A list in python is a collection of items
We can store different values in a list
Order matters in a list

# Creating a List
To make a list we use brackets [/] to surround out list
We seperate out the items using 

```python
some_list = ["John", "Tim", "Sara"]
```

# Access Elements in a List
We can grab things from lists using the bracket notation
In our example above, if I wanted to access "Tim", I would do the following 

```python
some_list[1] # "Lynn"
```
