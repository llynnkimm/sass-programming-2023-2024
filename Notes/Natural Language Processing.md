# Natural Language Processing
## Output
We can use a function to display text and symbols to the screen.
We use the `print` function to display output

```python
print("Your text goes in here")
```

[[Headers]]

## Comments
Comments are pieces of text that are not interpreted by Python.
This means that the text is ignored.
We use the # symbol to make comments.

```python
# This is a comment
```
