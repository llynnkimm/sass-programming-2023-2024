# Natural Language Processing
## Output
We can use a function to display text and symbols to the screen.
We use the `print` function to display output

```python
print("Your text goes in here")
```

[[Headers]]

## Comments
Comments are pieces of text that are not interpreted by Python.
This means that the text is ignored.
We use the # symbol to make comments.

```python
# This is a comment
```

# [[Strings]]

|   |
|---|
|# Format Strings|
|If we want to evaluate inside of a string, we use *f-strings*.|
|To create an f-string, we put an `f` before the open quote|
||
|```python|
|fave_food = input("What's your favourite food? ")|
||
|print(f"Ooooooo, {fave_food} sounds good!")|
|```|


*The Design Process* is the steps that we take when we create a solution to a problemThere are four steps in our design process
## 1. Design our Algorithm in English (or any human language)  
An *algorithm* is a sequence of steps to solve a problem  
In this class, *before* we start ANY programming, we write our steps in English.
## 2. Translate our Algorithm from English to Python

## 2. Translate our Algorithm from English to Python  
We'll translate our algorithm into "proper" Python.
## 3. Test our Python Algorithm  
Check if it works *syntactically*. In other words, we check to see if it BREAKS.  
Check if it works *semantically*. In other words, we ask does our algorithm
## 4. Share our Work  
Once it solves the problem, ship your code to whoever will use it.

# String Methods 

[[Methods]] are functions that we can use on [[objects]] 

String methods allow us to modify strings.

Say for example, we want to make all the characters of a string lowercase.

```python
mr_ubial_yelling = "YOU SHOULD PUSH YOUR CHAIRS IN"

print(mr_ubial_yelling.lower())
```

The `.lower()` method takes a string and converts all uppercase characters to lowercase
