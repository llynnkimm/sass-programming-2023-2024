# Recommendation Systems

## Popularity and Likes

This type of paradigm makes a suggestion based on how many people like the thing.

One prime example of this is the like button (heart) on instagram.
When you click that heart, instagram records it, and based on information it has on you, it might suggest that to someone else that is similar to you.

We created the favourite Bubble Tea service which is based on the "Popularity/Likes" paradigm of recommendation services.

## N-Point Rating Systems

N-Point rating systems are used by many services, but one that nearly everyone is familiar with is Amazon's main purchasing service.

This paradigm is where users rate a product out of a certain number.
